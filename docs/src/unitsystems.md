By default, `UnitSystems` provides a modern unified re-interpretation of various historical unit systems which were previously incompatible.
In order to make each `UnitSystem` consistently compatible with each other, a few convenience assumptions are made.
Specifically, it is assumed that all default modern unit systems share the same common `Universe` of dimensionless constants, although this can be optionally changed.
Therefore, the philosophy is to characterize differences among `UnitSystem` instances by means of dimensional constants.
As a result, all the defaults are ideal modern variants of these historical unit systems based on a common underlying `Universe`, which are completely consistent and compatible with each other.
These default `UnitSystem` values are to be taken as a newly defined mutually-compatible recommended standard, verified to be consistent and coherent.

## Metric SI Unit Systems

In the Systeme International d'Unites (the SI units) the `UnitSystem` constants are derived from the most accurate possible physical measurements and a few exactly defined constants.
Exact values are the `avogadro` number, `boltzmann` constant, `planck` constant, `lightspeed` definition, and elementary `charge` definition.

Construction of `UnitSystem` instances based on specifying the the constants `molarmass`, the `vacuumpermeability`, and the `molargas` along with some other options is facilitated by `MetricSystem`.
This construction helps characterize the differences between

Additional `Metric` variants with angle scaling include `MetricTurn`, `MetricSpatian`, `MetricGradian`, `MetricDegree`, `MetricArcminute`, `MetricArcsecond`.

Historically, the `josephson` and `klitzing` constants have been used to define `Conventional` and `CODATA` variants.

Originally, the practical units where specified by `resistance` and `electricpotential`.

## Electromagnetic CGS Systems

Alternatives to the SI unit system are the centimetre-gram-second variants, where the constants are rescaled with `centi*meter` and `milli` kilogram units along with introduction of additional `rationalization` and `lorentz` constants or electromagnetic units.

ESU
Gauss
LorentzHeaviside
```
There are multiple choices of elctromagnetic units for these variants based on electromagnetic units, electrostatic units, Gaussian non-rationalized units, and Lorentz-Heaviside rationalized units.
Note that `CGS` is an alias for the `Gauss` system.

## Modified (Entropy) Unit Systems

Most other un-natural unit systems are derived from the construction above by rescaling `time`, `length`, `mass`, `temperature`, and `gravity`; which results in modified entropy constants:

## Foot-Pound-Second-Rankine

In Britain and the United States an `English` system of engineering units was commonly used.

## Astronomical Unit Systems

The International Astronomical Union (IAU) units are based on the solar mass, distance from the sun to the earth, and the length of a terrestrial day.

## Natural Unit Systems

With the introduction of the `planckmass` a set of natural atomic unit systems can be derived in terms of the gravitational coupling constant.

```math
\alpha_G = \left(\frac{m_e}{m_P}\right)^2, \qquad \tilde k_B = 1, \qquad (\tilde M_u = 1, \quad \tilde \lambda = 1, \quad \tilde\alpha_L = 1)
```
